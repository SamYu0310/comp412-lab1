This tar file contains a src file which contains all relevant files needed to parse through a given file: a constants file (utilized to avoid string comparisons, integers are assigned to important variables instead to use for comparing), a parser file (contains parser), a scanner file (contains scanner called by parser), an intermediate_rep file (contains doubly linked list representation for data while parsing), and a 412fe file. The file 412fe acts as the "main" file. There are 4 flag options available when running this file: -h, -r, -p, -s. The -h flag acts as a helper which prints messages about what each of the flags do (this is the only flag that doesn't require a filename to be provided, the rest do). The -r flag will run 412fe on the provided filename and once it finishes parsing through it, it will return a readable doubly linked list where each node represents data containing line number, opcode, and sr's. The -p flag will run 412fe on the provided filename and report the number of lines sucessfully parsed and all the errors it found (this is also the default flag if no other flags are provided). The -s flag will run 412fe on the provided filename and print out all the tokens in the form of line number, token type, and lexeme. If multiple flags are provided the code will run with only one of the flags in order of hiearchy: -h, -r, -p, -s.
